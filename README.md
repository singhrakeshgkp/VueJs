## Ref vs Reactive
- ref we use with primitive type however reactive we use with object. ref we can use with both primitive and object but reactive can not be used with primitive
  ```
  access ref object
  employees=ref({name:'rakesh'})  employees[0].value.name    this way we can access ref object
  ```

## Directive
- **v-html**--> transform in html.
- **v-once**--> display variable content only once, even if variable value gets change dynamically that change will not refelect on the DOM where its applied.
- **v-bind**/ : --> bind variale (variable having url as content) to the element. v-bind shorthand is :(colon)
- **v-show**--> to show or hide
- **v-if**-->
